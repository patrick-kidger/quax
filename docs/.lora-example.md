```python
import equinox as eqx
import jax.random as jr
import quax
import quax.examples.lora as lora

#
# Start off with any JAX program: here, the forward pass through a linear layer.
#

key1, key2, key3 = jr.split(jr.PRNGKey(0), 3)
linear = eqx.nn.Linear(10, 12, key=key1)
vector = jr.normal(key2, (10,))

def run(model, x):
  return model(x)

run(linear, vector)  # can call this as normal

#
# Now let's Lora-ify it.
#

# Step 1: make the weight be a LoraArray.
lora_weight = lora.LoraArray(linear.weight, rank=2, key=key3)
lora_linear = eqx.tree_at(lambda l: l.weight, linear, lora_weight)
# Step 2: quaxify and call the original function. The transform will call the
# original function, whilst looking up any multiple dispatch rules registered.
# (In this case for doing matmuls against LoraArrays.)
quax.quaxify(run)(lora_linear, vector)
# Appendix: Quax includes a helper to automatically apply Step 1 to all
# `eqx.nn.Linear` layers in a model.
lora_linear = lora.loraify(linear, rank=2, key=key3)
